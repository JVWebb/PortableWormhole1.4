# PortableWormhole1.4
This mod adds a Portable Wormhole mirror which is crafted from 30 Wormhole Potions at a Crystal Ball.

The Portable Wormhole is non-consumable and lets you teleport to teammates as if you had a wormhole potion. It also lets you teleport to town NPCs.

It works from within your inventory, Piggy Bank, Safe, Void Vault, or Defender's Forge.

Functionality can be changed via ingame mod config.
